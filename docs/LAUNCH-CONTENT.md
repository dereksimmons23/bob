## Dec 23 Teaser (POSTED)

Posted across LinkedIn, X, Facebook, Instagram, Substack:

```
Tomorrow: a side project debuts at family Christmas Eve.

It settles debates. It crowns champions. It has an AI host who's seen too much.

Got a gathering this week? Try it out.

Built something fun for the holidays.

Every family gathering, the same debates happen:
- Best pizza topping (it's pepperoni, fight me)
- Best Christmas movie (Die Hard counts)
- Best 90s band (this one gets heated)

So I built Battle o' Brackets — a party game that turns debates into
tournament-style voting. 8 entrants go in, 1 champion comes out.

It has an AI host named BOB. He's... unimpressed by your choices.

"A tie. A TIE. Someone has to make the call. Not me. I'm just the host."

Built the whole thing in a week with Claude. One HTML file, no build process.
Christmas Eve debut went exactly as chaotically as expected.

Try it: bob.claudewill.io

What category would cause the most chaos at your family gathering?

```
Christmas Eve at our house means one thing: competitive debates.

Best pizza topping? Best Christmas movie? Best 90s sitcom?

So I built a game for it.

Battle o' Brackets: pick a category, vote head-to-head, crown a champion.

Complete with an AI host named BOB who has opinions.

### r/SideProject

**Title:** Built a party game with AI for family Christmas — Battle o' Brackets

```
Made this for our family Christmas Eve and thought others might enjoy it.

**What it is:**
A tournament-style voting game. Pick a category (Best Pizza Topping, Best
Christmas Movie, etc.), add entrants, and vote head-to-head until one
champion remains.

**The twist:**
An AI host named BOB provides commentary throughout. He's modeled after
my uncle — dry wit, deadpan delivery, strong opinions on food brackets.

Sample BOB quote: "A tie. A TIE. Someone has to make the call. Not me.
I'm just the host."

**Tech stack:**
- Single-file React PWA (no build process)
- Supabase for persistence
- Built with Claude in about a week

**Features:**
- 100+ preset categories
- Custom category builder
- Shareable bracket links
- Champion history (The Vault)
- Works offline as PWA

Link: bob.claudewill.io

Happy to answer questions about the build!

### r/webdev

**Title:** Shipped a single-file React PWA with no build process — here's what I learned

```
Just launched a side project built with an unusual constraint: no build
tooling at all.

**The project:** Battle o' Brackets — a party game for running
tournament-style voting (bob.claudewill.io)

**The stack:**
- React 18 via CDN
- Babel standalone for JSX transpilation
- Supabase JS via CDN
- Canvas API for share images
- Web Audio API for sounds
- All in one index.html file (~4000 lines)

**Why no build process?**
Started as a quick prototype, kept going. Wanted to see how far I could
push it.

**Pros:**
- Zero build errors, ever
- Instant deploys (just push HTML)
- Easy to debug (view source works)
- No node_modules, no package.json
- Runs from file:// for local testing

**Cons:**
- No tree-shaking (full React bundle)
- Can't use npm packages easily
- No TypeScript
- Hot reload = manual refresh
- Code organization is... creative

**Would I do it again?**
For a side project like this? Absolutely. The simplicity is liberating.
For a team project? Probably not.

Anyone else building without build tools? Curious about your experiences.
