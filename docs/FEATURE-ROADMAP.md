### 🔲 BOB Modes — Classic vs Salty
**Status:** Concept only (Dec 23, 2025)

Two personality modes for different audiences:

| Mode | Vibe | Implementation | Audience |
|------|------|----------------|----------|
| **Classic BOB** | Dry, deadpan, safe | Static dialogue (current) | All ages — default |
| **Salty BOB** | Unfiltered, seen-some-things energy | LLM-powered | Adults only — opt-in toggle |

**Classic BOB (Current):**
- Pre-written dialogue triggered by game events
- Works offline, zero API costs
- Fast, consistent, family-safe
- Limitation: can't react to specific matchups or custom categories intelligently

**Salty BOB (Future):**
- LLM-powered with custom system prompt
- Could react to actual bracket content ("Pineapple vs Pepperoni? Oh, we're going THERE.")
- Genuine opinions on specific matchups
- Could remember past brackets ("Didn't Ranch already lose to Ketchup?")
- Adult humor, unfiltered takes
- "2025 can kiss my ass on the way out" energy

**Implementation Notes:**
- Settings toggle: "BOB Mode: Classic / Salty 🧂 (18+)"
- Salty mode requires internet (API calls)
- Warning on toggle: "Salty BOB says things your grandma wouldn't approve of"
- Could be gated as premium feature

**Why Hybrid:**
- Magic of BOB is his *voice*, not intelligence — static lines often land harder
- LLM shines for custom categories where pre-written content impossible
- Different audiences need different modes (Timmy & Grandma Jean vs. adult game night)

### 🔲 Run It Back — Replay Previous Brackets
**Status:** Concept only

Replay brackets from The Vault with original or new voters.

- Select any past bracket from The Vault
- Re-run with same entrants, fresh votes
- Compare results: "Then vs Now" view
- Seasonal rotation: auto-surface relevant brackets (holiday music in December, chips during Super Bowl)
- Track how opinions shift over time

**Use cases:** Cheese, chips, holiday music, annual traditions

### 🔲 Banners & Banter Phase 2 — Public Feed
**Status:** Not started

- User accounts (optional)
- Public feed of recent brackets
- Basic reactions (🏆 Crown It, 🗑️ Trash Take)
- Profile pages
- Wordle-style text sharing (emoji grid for Twitter/iMessage)

### 🔲 Banners & Banter Phase 3 — Community
**Status:** Not started

- Following system
- Comments
- Category leaderboards (aggregated results)
- Notifications

See: `BANNERS-AND-BANTER-SOCIAL.md` for full concept

### 🔲 Bracket Visualization & Visual Identity
**Status:** Concept only (Dec 24, 2025)

Make the bracket structure more visible throughout the app. The *journey* is what makes brackets fun — seeing how the champion got there.

**Post-game bracket reveal:**
- After champion crowned, show the full tournament tree with all results filled in
- "Here's how it went down" — animated fill-in of the bracket path
- Tap to expand, see matchup details

**In-game bracket progress:**
- Mini bracket diagram in corner during gameplay
- Winners slide toward center, losers fade out
- Visual representation of narrowing field

**Share the journey:**
- Share card shows bracket path, not just champion
- Full tournament results in a visual format
- More interesting than "X beat Y"

**Bracket iconography:**
- Replace 🎯 dartboard in About modal with stylized bracket logo
- Consider custom bracket-shaped icon/emoji for app identity
- Consistent visual language: brackets = structure, ⚔️ = battle, 🏆 = victory

**Current emoji usage:**
- 🎯 About header, Quick Start — dartboard doesn't fit app theme
- ⚔️ Locked VS badge, Start Battle — works well for combat moments
- 🏆 Trophy — correct everywhere, keep as-is

### 🔲 Multi-Language Support
**Status:** Not built

- Spanish
- French
- German
- Portuguese
- Japanese

**Challenge:** BOB's personality needs localization, not just translation

### 🔲 Export/Import Categories
**Status:** Not built

- Export custom categories as JSON
- Import from file
- Share category packs

### 🔲 Mount Rushmore Edition
**Status:** Concept only (Dec 24, 2025)

Special 4-person bracket mode: "Who are your Final Four?" The constrained format forces tough cuts and guarantees arguments.

**Category Ideas:**
- Greatest Male Athletes (all sports)
- Greatest Female Athletes
- Greatest Athletes (combined)
- NBA Players
- NFL Quarterbacks
- Olympians
- Rock Bands
- Hip-Hop Artists
- Movie Directors
- SNL Cast Members
- Presidents
- Movie Villains
- Pizza Toppings (chaos mode)

**Implementation Options:**
- Special "Mount Rushmore" mode toggle (always 4 entrants)
- Dedicated category pack with pre-seeded debates
- Could combine with Spicy BOB for hot takes

**Why it works:** Everyone has a take. "You left off WHO?!" is the whole game.

### 🔲 Snub List
**Status:** Concept only

When creating a bracket, option to add "Notable Snubs" — entrants that didn't make the cut. BOB can reference them.

"I notice you left out Coldplay. Bold move."

### 🔲 Callback Humor
**Status:** Partial

BOB references past brackets if they're in the Vault.

"Pineapple? Again? Didn't we settle this last Thanksgiving?"

### 🔲 Milestone Reactions
**Status:** Not built

BOB acknowledges bracket milestones:
- "Your 10th bracket. We're practically family."
- "100 total voters. Democracy at scale."
- "First tie-breaker of the night. The chaos begins."

### 🔲 Entrant-Specific Hot Takes
**Status:** Not built

BOB has opinions on specific entrants:
- "Ah, Coldplay. Controversial choice. I'm watching you."
- "Pineapple on pizza. Here we go."
- "Turkey in the Thanksgiving bracket. Gutsy."

## Christmas Eve Playtest Learnings (Dec 24, 2025)

**The verdict:** Fine, not a hit. Lost to Herd Mentality and Hitster.

### What Worked
- [x] UX was intuitive — Jackson drove from iPhone with no friction
- [x] BOB's comments got laughs — personality is landing
- [x] Bobsled made the finals — BOB should have cheered for his namesake

### What Didn't Work
- [ ] **Topic selection is everything** — Winter Olympics and Pizza Toppings lacked controversy. Smells was better.
- [ ] **Consensus kills energy** — Pepperoni steamrolled. Everyone agreed. No debate.
- [ ] **Matchups weren't competitive** — Pineapple vs Spinach isn't a fair fight. Seeding problem.
- [ ] **No physical/sensory engagement** — Hitster has music, tasting games have food. BOB is all cognitive.
- [ ] **Sharing is broken** — Nobody shared (or couldn't). Need to investigate.

### Key Insight: Player Submission = Personal Stakes
The rock band bracket worked because everyone picked 4 bands. When YOUR pick is in the bracket, you're not just voting — you're defending your taste. When it gets knocked out, it stings.

**AI-generated brackets = passive judging**
**Player-submitted brackets = personal advocacy**

This might be the missing ingredient.

### Punch List

**Bugs:**
- [x] Fix sharing — was UX friction, not bug. Added native share sheet + auto-generate link
- [x] Player count captured wrong (4 instead of 10) — fixed with localStorage persistence

**Quick Wins:**
- [x] Add "Pizza Styles" bracket (NY, Chicago, Detroit, Neapolitan, etc.) — way better than toppings
- [x] BOB self-awareness — cheers for bobsled, bacon, bob-adjacent items
- [x] Curate "certified banger" topics — added Hot Takes section with featured categories
- [x] Lean Mode — "Trim to 8" and "Trim to 16" buttons for fewer entrants

**Medium Lift:**
- [ ] Smarter seeding — rank items by expected popularity, pair #1 vs #16
- [x] Capture vote margins in database — now tracks all matchup results with votes

**Bigger Rethink:**
- [ ] **Player-submitted brackets** — everyone submits 2-3 picks, BOB builds the bracket
- [ ] **BOB as activity companion** — pizza styles while eating pizza, beer bracket at a tasting
- [ ] Physical voting option — stand on sides of room, raise hands

### Comparison: What Made Other Games Hit

| Game | Why It Worked |
|------|---------------|
| **Herd Mentality** | Instant gratification. Answer → reveal → laugh. Zero waiting. Everyone engaged. |
| **Hitster** | Music does the heavy lifting. Nostalgia. Natural conversation starters. |
| **Rock Band Bracket** | Personal stakes. YOUR bands in the bracket. Defending your taste. |

BOB's current gap: Too much reading, not enough feeling. Brackets need controversy, stakes, or sensory hooks.
