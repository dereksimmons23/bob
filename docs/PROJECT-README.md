## Core Concept

- Family bracket voting game played at Thanksgiving/Christmas
- Ages 10-70 participate — generational warfare is the feature
- Tie-breakers by calling family members = hilarious chaos
- "Coldplay beat Foo Fighters" outcomes become family lore

---

## The Character: BOB

BOB is the AI game show host. His personality is a synthesis of:

**Uncle Bob (Robert Jake) DNA:**
- Bone dry wit, deadpan delivery
- Irish Goodbye professional — doesn't linger
- Always twitchy (leg shaking, looking for exit)
- 4:30 AM letter writer energy — drops profound observations, moves on
- One of 11 kids — nothing surprises him

**Famous Bob Influences:**
- Bob Barker — warmth, genuine care for contestants
- Bob Newhart — slow burn, understated comedy
- Alex Trebek — measured authority with wit
- Bob Eubanks — deadpan reactions to chaos

**BOB's Voice:**
- Never yells. Even in championship moments, he's measured.
- Says devastating things casually.
- Has strong opinions on food brackets.
- Understands chaos. "I've seen worse."

## Development Guidelines

When working on Battle o' Brackets:

1. **Maintain BOB's personality** — dry, deadpan, measured. Never oversells.
2. **Keep single-file architecture** — no build process, runs in browser.
3. **Preserve localStorage keys** — don't break existing user data.
4. **All categories need full entrant lists** — 8-16 items minimum.
5. **Mobile-first design** — touch-friendly, responsive.
6. **Sound effects are optional** — fail silently on audio errors.
