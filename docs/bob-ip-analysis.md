# Battle o' Brackets: IP Landscape Analysis

## Executive Summary

**Risk Level: LOW to MODERATE**

The name "Battle o' Brackets" appears available for trademark registration. Game show formats and game rules are NOT protected by copyright — only specific expressions (scripts, graphics, code) receive protection. The primary IP concern is ensuring the name and BoB character don't infringe existing trademarks.

---

## 1. Trademark Analysis

### 1.1 "Battle o' Brackets" Name Search

**Direct Conflicts Found: NONE**

- No USPTO registrations found for "Battle o' Brackets" or "Battle of Brackets"
- Closest existing mark: "Bracket Battle" (used by Swift Alert app as feature name, also bracketbattle.com exists)
- The "o'" construction and word order reversal ("Battle o' Brackets" vs "Bracket Battle") provides meaningful differentiation

**Similar Names in the Space:**
| Name | Owner | Status | Conflict Risk |
|------|-------|--------|---------------|
| Bracket Battle | Swift Alert / bracketbattle.com | Active | LOW (different construction) |
| Challonge | Challonge LLC | Active | NONE |
| Tourney | TourneyMaker | Active | NONE |
| BracketCloud | BracketCloud | Active | NONE |

**Recommendation:** "Battle o' Brackets" is sufficiently distinct. The apostrophe construction, word order, and "of" vs "Battle" positioning differentiate it from "Bracket Battle."

### 1.2 "BoB" / "Uncle BoB" Character Analysis

**Potential Conflicts Found:**

1. **"UNCLE BOB'S"** — Trademark Serial No. 88222992
   - Owner: Rystin Ventures, LLC
   - Status: **ABANDONED** (failure to respond, Oct 2019)
   - Class: Restaurant and bar services
   - Conflict Risk: **NONE** (different class, abandoned)

2. **"Uncle Bob"** — Disney's Goof Troop character
   - Status: Active (fictional character)
   - Context: Minor character in one episode
   - Conflict Risk: **LOW** (different context, no trademark on name itself)

3. **Bob Barker / Bob Eubanks / Bob Newhart** — Public figures
   - Status: Public figures, not trademarkable names
   - Conflict Risk: **NONE** (unless explicitly imitating)

**Recommendation:** "BoB" as an AI game host is safe. The character is clearly an acronym ("Battle o' Brackets"), not an imitation of any real person. The personality inspiration from various Bobs is legal — you can't copyright a "deadpan delivery style."

### 1.3 Trademark Registration Strategy

**USPTO Filing Options:**

| Application Type | Cost per Class | Best For |
|-----------------|----------------|----------|
| TEAS Plus | $250 | Pre-defined goods/services from ID Manual |
| TEAS Standard | $350 | Custom descriptions |

**Recommended Classes:**
- **Class 9**: Computer software; mobile applications; downloadable game software
- **Class 41**: Entertainment services; providing online games

**Estimated Costs:**
- Base filing (2 classes): $500-700
- Comprehensive search (optional): $300-1,000
- Attorney fees (optional but recommended): $1,275-1,800
- **Total DIY route**: ~$700
- **Total with attorney**: ~$2,000-2,500

**Timeline:**
- Initial filing to publication: 7-9 months
- Publication to registration (if no opposition): 6-12 months
- **Total**: 12-18 months

**Filing Basis Options:**
1. **Use in Commerce** — If already deployed publicly (Christmas Eve debut qualifies)
2. **Intent to Use** — If filing before public deployment (requires additional $150/class later)

## 2. Copyright Analysis

### 2.1 What IS Protected (Your Original Work)

✅ **Your actual code** — The React application, all JavaScript, CSS
✅ **BoB's specific dialogue** — The exact commentary lines you've written
✅ **Visual design** — Specific UI elements, color schemes as expressed
✅ **Documentation** — Written descriptions, user guides
✅ **The BoB Character Bible** — As a creative work

### 2.2 What is NOT Protected

❌ **Game mechanics** — Bracket-style voting cannot be copyrighted
❌ **The concept** — "Vote on things in a bracket" is an idea, not expression
❌ **Game rules** — Rules are not copyrightable (established law)
❌ **Format** — TV game show formats have very limited protection

**Legal Precedent:**
> "The United States Copyright Office specifically notes: 'Copyright does not protect the idea for a game, its name or title, or the method or methods for playing it.'"

> "The rules for how to play a game are generally pretty clearly established as not captured in copyright."

**Implication:** Someone could legally create a competing bracket voting game. They could NOT copy your:
- Code
- BoB's exact dialogue
- Specific visual assets
- Written documentation

### 2.3 Automatic Copyright Protection

Your original creative work is automatically copyrighted upon creation. Registration with the U.S. Copyright Office ($45-65) provides:
- Public record of ownership
- Ability to sue for statutory damages
- Presumption of validity

**Recommendation:** Register copyright on the codebase and BoB Character Bible after launch. Low priority but good hygiene.

## 3. Patent Analysis

### 3.1 Relevant Existing Patents

**US11731056B2 — "System, method, and apparatus for improved bracket contests"**
- Filed: 2021
- Focus: **Predicting outcomes** of real tournaments (NCAA, sports)
- Key distinction: This covers prediction/gambling mechanics, NOT preference voting

**Relevant Quote from Patent:**
> "The tournament is a structured set of matches between inanimate objects such as artwork or songs that are voted to win/lose by viewers/listeners."

This patent acknowledges voting brackets exist but focuses on the **prediction scoring system**, not the voting mechanic itself.

**US5779242A — Tournament progression method**
- Filed: 1995
- Focus: Double-elimination tournament structures
- Conflict Risk: **NONE** (describes tournament flow, not voting games)

### 3.2 Patent Risk Assessment

**Risk Level: LOW**

Battle o' Brackets is a **preference voting game**, not a prediction contest. Key differences:
- No scoring based on "correct" predictions
- No real-world tournament outcomes
- Pure opinion-based elimination

The mechanics of bracket elimination voting are well-established and would be considered "prior art" or unpatentable "abstract ideas."

**Recommendation:** No patent filing needed. The game mechanics are not novel inventions — they're implementations of common voting structures.

## 4. Competitive Landscape

### 4.1 Existing Bracket Apps

| Easypromos | Marketing brackets | B2B SaaS | Enterprise, not consumer |
| Swift Alert Bracket Battle | Fan voting | App feature | Taylor Swift specific |
| Common Ninja | Website widget | SaaS | Developer tool, not standalone |

### 4.2 BoB's Unique Position

**No direct competitor offers:**
1. AI host personality with commentary
2. Party game format (in-person, facilitator mode)
3. Category-specific reactions
4. Hall of Fame / persistent game memory
5. Family-friendly focus with absurdist humor
