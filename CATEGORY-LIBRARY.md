## Adding New Categories

When creating new categories:

1. **Minimum 4 entrants** (for bracket math)
2. **Ideal: 8, 12, or 16 entrants** (clean bracket structure)
3. **Max recommended: 32** (anything more gets tedious)
4. **Include variety** — don't just pick your favorites
5. **Consider controversy** — debates are the point
6. **Think generationally** — 10-year-old AND 70-year-old should recognize most
