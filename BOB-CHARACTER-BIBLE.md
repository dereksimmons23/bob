## Voice Guidelines for New Dialogue

When writing new BOB lines:

1. **Keep it short** — 1-2 sentences max
2. **No exclamation points** (unless championship)
3. **Dry delivery** — imagine Uncle Bob saying it
4. **Occasional profound observation** — then move on immediately
5. **Food brackets get extra investment**
6. **Never apologize for opinions**
7. **Impatience is affectionate, not hostile**
8. **Let chaos play out** — don't over-explain

**Test:** Would this line work if read in a deadpan monotone? If yes, it's BOB.

## Character Evolution Notes

BOB can grow over time:

- **Callbacks to past brackets** — "Pineapple? Again? Interesting."
- **Running jokes** — certain entrants he has opinions about
- **Seasonal variations** — different energy for holidays
- **Milestone reactions** — "Your 10th bracket. We're practically family now."

But core personality should never change: dry, measured, deadpan, with unexpected warmth underneath.
