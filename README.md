# Battle o' Brackets™

> *The party game where democracy gets dumb. Hosted by BOB.*

**Battle o' Brackets** is a tournament-style voting game for family gatherings, parties, and anywhere opinions clash. Vote head-to-head until a champion is crowned. Ties? Phone a friend. Chaos? That's the feature.

🏆 **Live:** [battle-of-brackets.netlify.app](https://battle-of-brackets.netlify.app)

## What Is This?

A PWA (Progressive Web App) that runs bracket-style voting tournaments. Pick a category ("Best Pizza Topping"), add entrants, and let the room vote until one champion remains.

**Perfect for:**
- Thanksgiving/Christmas family debates
- Party games (ages 10–70)
- Settling "Best Of" arguments once and for all
- Creating family lore ("Remember when Pineapple beat Pepperoni?")

## Development Guidelines

1. **Maintain BOB's personality** — Dry, deadpan, measured. Never oversells. See `src/data/bob.js`
2. **Modular architecture** — Components in `src/components/`, screens in `src/screens/`
3. **Use hooks for logic** — Game logic in `src/hooks/`, shared state in `src/context/`
4. **Preserve localStorage keys** — Don't break existing user data. See `src/lib/storage.js`
5. **Mobile-first design** — Touch-friendly, responsive. Inline styles preferred.
6. **Sound effects optional** — Fail silently on audio errors. See `src/lib/sound.js`
7. **Categories need full lists** — 8-16 entrants minimum. See `src/data/categories.js`
8. **Run build before deploy** — `npm run build` must succeed
